Computational linguistics is a field that combines linguistics and computer science. It involves processing and analyzing natural language using computers. This field has many applications, including machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. One of the key tasks in computational linguistics is extracting meaningful information from text, which often involves identifying relevant keywords or tags. Stop words, such as "the" and "is," are common words that are usually filtered out during this process. Once the relevant tags are extracted, they can be used for tasks like text summarization or information retrieval.
